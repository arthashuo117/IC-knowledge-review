# IC-knowledge-review
As an experienced engineer with three years in the field, I understand the challenges of retaining and revisiting knowledge gained from past projects. The relentless pace of work, coupled with the ever-expanding scope of responsibilities, can make it difficult to recall specific details or revisit the wealth of information accumulated over time.

To address this, Iâ€™ve embarked on this personal project to review the knowledge I acquired.
